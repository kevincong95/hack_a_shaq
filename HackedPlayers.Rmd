Load the hack log, and get the number of times each playerID shows up. The all_players.csv maps playerIDs to names.

```{r}
hacks <- read.csv("hack_master.csv")
hackedPlayers <- table(hacks$HackedPlayerID)
hackedIDs <- names(hackedPlayers) #IDs of players targeted
```

Repeat for how often teams hack or get hacked.

```{r}
hackers <- table(hacks$Team) #who likes to hack?
hackees <- table(hacks$Opp) #which teams get hacked?
```

Clean up the player directory. Keep only those players who were on a roster during the 2015-16 season. Then sort by lowest FT rate, provided that this FT rate is lower than 70% (otherwise expected value of 2 free throws is greater than 1 point)
```{r}
allPlayers <- read.csv("all_players.csv")
allPlayers <- allPlayers[allPlayers$ROSTERSTATUS == 1,]
allPlayers <- allPlayers[order(allPlayers$FT_RATE15),]
vulnerable <- allPlayers[allPlayers$FT_RATE15 > 0,]
vulnerable <- vulnerable[vulnerable$FT_RATE15 < 0.7,]
```

Players who have been targeted at least 10 times over the last 3 require our attention. "targets" should be an array of length 12.

```{r}
targets <- hackedPlayers[which(hackedPlayers >= 10)]
```
